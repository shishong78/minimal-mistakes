This work was published in [*Science*](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/362/6421/1410).

I had some incredibly insightful collaborators, [Michael Macy](https://sites.google.com/site/michaelmacy14/home) and [Josh Blumenstock](http://www.jblumenstock.com/).

Here is a [short video](https://www.dropbox.com/s/t847u2lrwxsbt5e/scipak_strength_of_long_ties.mp4?dl=0) that explains the main findings of this work.


Here's some basic text.

And here's some *italics*

Here's some **bold** text.

Here's a bulleted list:
* First item
+ Second item
- Third item

Here's a numbered list:
1. First
2. Second
3. Third

Python code block:
```python
    import numpy as np

    def test_function(x, y):
      z = np.sum(x,y)
      return z
```

R code block:
```r
library(tidyverse)
df <- read_csv("some_file.csv")
head(df)
```

Here's some inline code `x+y`.

Here's some math:

$$z=x+y$$

You can also put it inline $$z=x+y$$
