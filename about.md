I am a computational social scientist with research interests in the structure and evolution of large-scale social networks. My research focuses on how people form and maintain social ties and how the broader social, economic and natural environments affect this process. I conduct social network research at a number of thematic intersections, including social contagion, economic sociology, social psychology, the diffusion of innovation, and social movements using empirical data that capture population-scale online social interactions.

As a data science fellow at the Michigan Institute for Data Science, I enjoy interdisciplinary collaboration with researchers from a broad range of backgrounds, from sociologists, computer/information scientists, management scientists, and political scientists. My research were published in *Science*, *Social Networks*, *PLoS One*, *Lecture Notes in Computer Science*, and *Big Data and Society*.
